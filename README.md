# Hangman: introductory project of the AiCore curriculum.

The project is an implementation of the classic hangman game, where the computer selects a word at random from a list of words, and the user attempts to guess it.

For detailed documentation of the project see: [ProjectDocumentation.md](https://github.com/tuttonluke/Hangman_project/blob/master/ProjectDocumentation.md).
