# Hangman: introductory project of the AiCore curriculum.

The project is an implementation of the classic hangman game, where the computer selects a word at random from a list of words, and the user attempts to guess it.

To play the game, run the play_game function in the file [main.py](https://github.com/tuttonluke/aicore_hangman_project/blob/master/main.py), passing in a list of words as an argument, from which one will be randomly chosen for the user to guess.

For detailed documentation of the project see: [ProjectDocumentation.md](https://github.com/tuttonluke/Hangman_project/blob/master/ProjectDocumentation.md).
